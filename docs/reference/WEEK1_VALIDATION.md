- Proper error handling

**Evidence**: `internal/storage/spaces.go` (129 lines)

**Status**:  **CODE COMPLETE** (needs DO account setup)

---

### 5. Developer Experience 
**Additional Work** (not required but valuable):
- `Makefile` with 15+ commands
- `SETUP.md` comprehensive guide (282 lines)
- `WEEK1_STATUS.md` tracking document
- `.env.example` template
- Updated `.gitignore` for security
- Fixed GitHub Actions (Go 1.25)

**Evidence**:
- `Makefile` (133 lines)
- `SETUP.md` (282 lines)

**Status**:  **COMPLETE**

---

##  WHAT NEEDS VERIFICATION (Not Code - Just Running It)

### A. Local Environment Validation (5-10 minutes)

**Task**: Prove the local environment works

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Start Docker (2 min)
docker compose up -d

# 2. Apply migrations (2 min)
npx prisma migrate dev

# 3. Start server (1 min)
go run main.go

# 4. Test endpoints (1 min)
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/health/db

# 5. Verify in Adminer (2 min)
# Open http://localhost:8080, check tables exist
```

**Acceptance**:
-  Docker running
-  Database tables created
-  Health endpoints return 200 OK
-  Can view schema in Adminer

**Status**:  **PENDING** (you need to run this)

---

### B. Production Deployment Prep (Optional for Week 1)

The development plan says "prepare DigitalOcean DB & Spaces" - this could mean:

**Interpretation 1**: Code is ready to use DO ( You've done this)
**Interpretation 2**: Actually provision DO resources ( Not done yet)

**What's needed** (if Interpretation 2):
1. Create DigitalOcean account
2. Provision Managed Postgres cluster (10 min via UI)
3. Create Spaces bucket (5 min via UI)
4. Generate access keys (2 min)

**Status**:  **PENDING** (Week 2 work)

---

##  DELIVERABLE ASSESSMENT

### Official Requirement: "Functional local environment and ready-to-deploy DB"

**Breakdown**:

| Component | Required? | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Docker configured |  Yes |  Done | docker-compose.yml exists |
| Postgres schema |  Yes |  Done | Prisma schema complete |
| Local environment functional |  Yes |  Needs validation | Needs to be run |
| Ready-to-deploy DB |  Yes |  Done | Migrations ready for deploy |
| DigitalOcean "prepared" |  Unclear |  Partial | Code ready, resources not provisioned |

---

##  WEEK 1 COMPLETION VERDICT

### Code Deliverables:  **100% COMPLETE**

You've written all the code for:
-  Docker environment
-  Database schema (all 9 models)
-  Backend structure (db, health, storage)
-  Developer tools
-  Documentation

### Validation Status:  **PENDING LOCAL TESTING**

What you need to do:
1. Run Docker containers (2 min)
2. Apply migrations (2 min)
3. Test server (2 min)

**Total Time**: ~5-10 minutes

### Production Prep:  **WEEK 2 TERRITORY**

Based on the development plan, Week 2 is when you "Deploy backend to DigitalOcean". So provisioning DO resources is arguably Week 2 work.

---

##  DEMO READINESS

### For Sponsor Demo Tomorrow:

**Can you demo Week 1?**
 **YES** - with 10 minutes of validation

**What to show**:
1.  GitHub commit (already done)
2.  Code structure (already done)
3.  Database schema (already done)
4.  Local environment running (needs 10 min to validate)
5.  Production deployment (Week 2 - optional)

**Recommendation**:
-  **Run validation script ASAP** (10 minutes)
-  **Demo local environment** (proves Week 1 complete)
-  **Mention production deployment** is Week 2 scope
-  **Emphasize infrastructure foundation** you've built

---

##  VALIDATION CHECKLIST (DO THIS NOW)

```bash
# Quick validation (10 minutes total):

[ ] 1. cd to project directory
[ ] 2. Run: docker compose up -d
[ ] 3. Wait 10 seconds
[ ] 4. Run: docker compose ps (verify 2 containers)
[ ] 5. Run: npx prisma migrate dev
[ ] 6. Open new terminal

If all 12 steps pass  WEEK 1 VALIDATED 
```

2. Deploy migrations to production
3. Deploy Go backend to Render/DigitalOcean
4. Configure CORS for frontend

-  All infrastructure code written
-  Complete database schema
-  Health endpoints implemented
-  Storage integration coded
-  Documentation complete
-  Pushed to GitHub

**What's Pending** (5%):
